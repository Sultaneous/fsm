### <a id="info_fsm">FSM</a>

A Finite State Machine (**FSM**), in Computer Science terms, is a "directed graph".  It is **finite**, as there is a complete path from start to termination.
It is **Stateful** as it consists of a number of states that execute independently until a trigger condition occurs to force a transition to another state.
It is a machine, because a well designed FSM can be given input and run independently.

An FSM is also known as a Deterministic Finite Automaton (**DFA**). It is deterministic, because when given the same input it will always produce the same
output (randomness aside).  It is finite as per above.  And it is an automaton, which is another name for automatic machine.

#### FSM Module

The FSM module is a complete engine for creating and executing FSMs.  It restricts state scope to local, with the exception of a **Context** object,
which is responsible for making shared information accessible.  It uses a base **State** Class, which provides a method (**run()**) to be overridden, 
to contain your specific state logic. And it is an automated machine, providing a **Dispatcher** class, which controls State transitions, instantiates
desired states, and monitors progress until completion.

Using the FSM module is simple.

#### Part 1 -> Create an FSM Diagram
Before starting to code, you should create a diagram containing each state, their triggers and which states they transition to.

The following diagram is an example only.  Later, we will design a diagram for a basic network handshake protocol, and convert it to an FSM machine
using **fsm-gen**.
![Example FSM Diagram](https://github.com/Sultaneous/fsm/blob/master/assets/example_FSM_diagram.png "Example FSM Diagram")

#### Part 2 -> Convert FSM Diagram to code
1. You create a class based on **State** base class:
```python
class MyState(State):
```

2. You call the base constructor with your State's  **plain-language label** (meant for ease of reference):
```python
   def __init__(self, stateName):
      super().__init__(stateName)
```

2. You **override the run() function** and provide your logic for this specific state:
```python
   def run(context):
      # TODO: Replace this with your logic
      print()
      print(f"Currently in {self.name}")
```

3. Still in **run()**, you add your triggers and the appropriate state to transition to:
```python
      # Example only
      if (input=""):
         context.setNextState("STATE_END_OF_FILE")
      else:
         context.setNextState("STATE_PARSE_LABEL")
```

**Example State Class**
```python
class State1(State):
   def __init__(self, stateName):
      super().__init__(stateName)

   def run(self, context):
      print()
      print(f"Currently in {self.name}")
      super().run(context)
      context.setNextState("State2")

      print (f"Next state is {context.getNextState()}.")
# End of class State1
```

#### Part 3 -> The 5 Step main()
Starting the FSM is simple.  There are 5 required steps:
1. Create the context object.  Populate it with any required initial values.
```python
def main():
   # 1. Create our context 
   context = Context("MyApp")
   # Populate it with any initial values
   context.set("infile", "data.txt")
   context.set("outfile", "temp.out")
   context.set("property", "value")
```

2. Name the initial (starting) state:
```python
   # 2. Identify the first state to instantiate
   context.setNextState("MyStartState")
```

3. Create a dispatcher object.
```python
   # 3. Create our dispatcher
   dispatcher = Dispatcher(context)
```

4. Execute our dispatcher, starting and running the state machine to completion; note we must pass it our current context.
```python
   # 4. dispatcher.dispatch(context)
```

5. We're done, report any exit message
```python
   # 5. Done
   print ("SUCCESS!")
```

**Example main() function**
```python
# Only five steps are needed to run the FSM.
def main():
   # 1. Create our context
   context=Context("FSM")
   # (Populate it with some dummy values for this test)
   context.set("Module", "FSM")
   context.set("Counter", 0)

   # 2. Identify the first state to instantiate
   context.setNextState("State1")

   # 3. Create our dispatcher
   dispatcher=Dispatcher()

   # 4. Dispatch! This executes the FSM
   dispatcher.dispatch(context)

   # 5. Done
   print("SUCCESS!")
# End of main

if __name__=="__main__":
   main()
```

#### Code Template Generation
If you are creating FSMs, it is highly recommended you use the [fsm-gen](#info_fsm-gen) utility. It will build the scaffolding and you will need only to
enter your state logic in each appropriate derived State class. It is recommended to use the fsm-gen tool once you have completed your FSM diagram.

### <a id="info_ContextClass">Context Class</a>

The **Context Class** is used to create context information for the FSM - contextual data for each state, which can be shared with other states.
Each state is considered independent. Persistent (global) information must be passed to it through the context object, which at its core is a dictionary
of properties.

| Method | Alias(es) | Parameters | Returns | Summary |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| __init__() | None | string contextName | Class instance | The default constructor takes one parameter, which is typically the name of the FSM being implemented. |
| set() | push(), put() | string key, var value| nothing | Puts a property (*Key=value*) into the context dictionary. |
| get() | peek(), pop() | string key | value, or *None* | Retrieves key value, if key exists; else returns *None*. |
| delete() | None | string key | nothing | If the key exists in dictionary, deletes it (and value). |
| clear() | None | None | nothing | Deletes all keys and resets context dictionary to empty. |
| getAll() | None | None | string JSON formatted object of all key=value properties, if any. | Creates a JSON representation of the context properties. |
| setNextState() | None | string className | The name of the class to instantiate and invoke (via *run()*) for the next state. |
| getNextState() | None | None | Returns the name of the class for the next state, if any is defined. | Should be defined by *setNextState()* first. |
| count() | None | None | int Number of properties in the context dictionary. | Executes *len(self.__dict)*. |
| exists() | None | string key | True if key exists, False otherwise. | **NOTE**: Returns True if key exists and value is *None*. |

### <a id="info_StateClass">State Class</a>

The **State Class** is 

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Summary |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------|

### <a id="info_DispatcherClass">Dispatcher Class</a>

The **Dispatcher Class** is the engine of the FSM, which invokes and switches States as required based on triggers. It has only one method, **dispatch()**,
which must be called with a valid Context object.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Summary |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| dispatch() | Context object | nothing | When provided a valid context object, will determine the correct python pathing to the required derived State class to instantiate, and execute the finite state machine. |
